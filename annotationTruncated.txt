MODIFIED COEFFICIENT RESOLUTION: A metadata review found that calibration values for this sensor ({}) were mistakenly truncated and did not have the correct number of significant digits during deployment {}, which could result in delivery of incorrect L1 or L2 derived values during that time range. The truncated calibration values have now been corrected and verified as of {}. All derived L1 and L2 data products generated prior to the annotation date for deployment {} for the time range {} - {} should be re-requested in order to ensure utilization of the correct calibration values. The updated values can be viewed at {}.
